    <h1>How to publish your website on github</h1>
    <p>Hi, I saw your qustion on github and made a new repository for you on github so that you can publish your website on github.</p>
    <p>Remember that you can only make repository on github. I you want to ern money, you won't be able to do that. For this use other websites like godaddy, hostgator etc.</p>
